This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Testing Offline Mode

By default, the service worker is disabled in development. To test offline functionality locally:

```bash
# Enable PWA in development mode
DEBUG_OFFLINE=true npm run dev
```

Once the app is running with offline mode enabled:

1. Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
2. Check "Offline" to simulate offline mode
3. Navigate through the app - you should see the offline fallback page when trying to load new pages
4. Existing cached pages should still work

The offline page is available at `/offline` and will automatically be shown when:
- Network requests fail
- User is offline
- Navigation to uncached pages occurs

Note: Make sure to unregister old service workers and clear cache when testing to see fresh changes.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
